				<h4>Rosemary and Jonathan</h4>
				<p>Anthony captured all the shots that we discussed with him prior to the wedding plus so many more! We appreciated his personal approach, as he really listened to our ideas and also advised what would work best based on his recent experiences.</p>
				<p>He took a wide variety of photos so we were spoilt for choice for our album and have been able to re-live the memories of our special day. In particular, the dvd of photos was fantastic for some family and friends who couldn't make it to the wedding.</p>
				<p>When taking shots, Anthony was quick to put us and the guests at ease with his friendly manner. Many also commented how unobtrusive and professional he was, which we felt was very important during the ceremony itself.</p>
				<p>We were extremely happy with the end product and will definitely be recommending him to our engaged friends! Many thanks!</p>

				<h4>Rowena and Matthew</h4>
				<p>Having viewed Anthony’s pictures from previous events, there was no question as to who our photographer would be for our wedding day. Prior to the big day, we met on several occasions and conversed through email to discuss the style of photography and the order of the day. To be completely honest, our knowledge of wedding photography was minimal so we had no idea how to even prepare for the pictures on the day. However, Anthony had a wealth of experience and advice to offer and guided us from beginning to end, making us feel completely relaxed during such an important day in our lives.</p>
				<p>The standard of photography was outstanding and we loved his choice of shots that he artistically revamped. In addition, his natural ability to make people feel comfortable and at ease meant that we were lucky enough to have many wonderful pictures of our guests as well. We have plenty of fantastic pictures to enjoy on the DVD, which has been great for showing to family and friends from across the Atlantic who couldn’t make it to the wedding.</p>
